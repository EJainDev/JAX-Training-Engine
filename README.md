# Flax Training Engine

## What is It?

Flax Training Engine is a highly optimized, JAX and Flax based training engine for machine learning models. It provides a low overhead training loop that allows users to effectively train their models and run them on potentially, low capacity devices.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply use `pip install flax-training-engine` or for more flexibility clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/EJainDev/Flax-Training-Engine` and then customize it to your needs. Once you have it setup, the relevant import is `from flax_training_engine import train` which provides the `train` method to handle your model training. The version can be accessed through the `(MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH|TWEAK)_VERSION` imports.
